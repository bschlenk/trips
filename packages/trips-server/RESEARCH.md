Trying to calculate the tax added to car2go trips

Here is an example:

14 minuts             | $6.30
Driver Protection Fee | $1.00
Tax/VAT (Seattle)     | $1.30

Total                 | $8.60

Tax % = 17.8


Another example:

30 minute package | $9.00
Driver Protection | $1.00
Tax/VAT (Seattle) | $1.78

Total             | $11.78

Tax % = 17.8
